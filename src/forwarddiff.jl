# ForwardDiff Dual number support for MacroModelling.jl
# This file contains function definitions that handle ForwardDiff.Dual types
# for automatic differentiation using forward mode.

# These functions are included directly in the main module (not an extension)
# because they are essential for the package's core functionality.
