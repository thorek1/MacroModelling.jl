# Todo list

## High priority

- [ ] implement occasionally binding constraints with shocks
- [ ] cover nested case: min(50,a+b+max(c,10))
- [ ] nonlinear estimation using unscented kalman filter
- [ ] nonlinear conditional forecasts
- [ ] add balanced growth path handling
- [ ] feedback: write out RBC equations, provide option for external SS guess, sell the sampler better (ESS vs dynare), more details on algorithm (SS solver)
- [ ] recheck function examples and docs (include output description)
- [ ] riccati with analytical derivatives (much faster if sparse) instead of implicit diff
- [ ] add user facing option to choose sylvester solver
- [ ] autocorr and covariance with derivatives. return 3d array
- [ ] Docs: document outputs and associated functions to work with function
- [ ] use ID for sparse output sylvester solvers (filed issue)
- [ ] make higher order usable with zygote (currently only analytical pushforward, no implicitdiff)
- [ ] add pydsge and econpizza to overview
- [ ] use other quadratic iteration for diffable first order solve (useful because schur can error in estimation)
- [ ] add for loop parser in @parameters
- [ ] include option to provide pruned states for irfs
- [ ] compressed higher order derivatives and sparsity of jacobian
- [ ] implement more multi country models
- [ ] speed benchmarking (focus on ImplicitDiff part)
- [ ] write docs for (non-linear) solution algorithms
- [ ] have initial_state accept SS and SSS as arguments
- [ ] for cond forecasting and kalman, get rid of observables input and use axis key of data input
- [ ] for cond forecasting allow less shocks than conditions with a warning. should be svd then
- [ ] have parser accept rss | (r[ss] - 1) * 400 = rss
- [ ] when doing calibration with optimiser have better return values when he doesnt find a solution (probably NaN)
- [ ] sampler returned negative std. investigate and come up with solution ensuring sampler can continue
- [ ] automatically adjust plots for different legend widhts and heights
- [ ] include weakdeps: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Weak-dependencies
- [ ] have get_std take variables as an input
- [ ] more informative errors when something goes wrong when writing a model
- [ ] initial state accept keyed array
- [ ] bring solution error into an object of the model so we dont have to pass it on as output
- [ ] check that there is an error if he cant find SS
- [ ] plot_model_estimates with unconditional forecast at the end
- [ ] check if you can do analytic derivatives for higher order derivatives
- [ ] kick out unused parameters from m.parameters
- [ ] higher order solution derivs with Zygote
- [ ] use cache for gradient calc in estimation (see DifferentiableStateSpaceModels)
- [ ] speed up sparse matrix calcs in implicit diff of higher order funcs
- [ ] improve docs: timing in first sentence seems off; have something more general in first sentence; why is the syntax user friendly? give an example; make the former and the latter a footnote
- [ ] streamline estimation part (dont do string matching... but rely on precomputed indices...)
- [ ] change docs to reflect that the output of irfs include aux vars and also the model info Base.show includes aux vars
- [ ] write functions to debug (fix_SS.jl...)
- [ ] model compression (speed up 2nd moment calc (derivatives) for large models; gradient loglikelihood is very slow due to large matmuls) -> model setup as maximisation problem (gEcon) -> HANK models

- [ ] add more models
- [ ] plot multiple solutions or models - multioptions in one graph

- [ ] use strings instead of symbols internally
- [ ] write how-to for calibration equations
- [ ] make the nonnegativity trick optional or use nanmath?
- [ ] use packages for kalman filter
- [ ] clean up different parameter types
- [ ] clean up printouts/reporting

- [ ] figure out combinations for inputs (parameters and variables in different formats for get_irf for example)
- [ ] Find any SS by optimising over both SS guesses and parameter inputs
- [ ] weed out SS solver and saved objects
