# Todo list

## High priority

- [ ] ss transition by entering new parameters at given periods
- [ ] check downgrade tests
- [ ] have a workspace in the model object. to be accessed for example by the riccati solver at each run (instead of initialising values at each function call)
- [ ] check why PG samples are off
- [ ] implement estimation tests for all models
- [ ] optimise vanilla loglikelihood calculation and gradient thereof (incl comp time)
- [ ] checkout dynamic perturbation for obc solution: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~alexmen/dynamic_perturbation.pdf
- [ ] checkout schedule free ADAM for global methods: https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free
- [ ] figure out why PG and IS return basically the prior
- [ ] allow external functions to calculate the steady state (and hand it over via SS or get_loglikelihood function) - need to use the check function for implicit derivatives and cannot use it to get him a guess from which he can use internal solver going forward
- [ ] go through custom SS solver once more and try to find parameters and logic that achieves best results
- [ ] SS solver with less equations than variables
- [ ] improve docs: timing in first sentence seems off; have something more general in first sentence; why is the syntax user friendly? give an example; make the former and the latter a footnote
- [ ] write tests/docs/technical details for nonlinear obc, forecasting, (non-linear) solution algorithms, SS solver, obc solver, and other algorithms
- [ ] change docs to reflect that the output of irfs include aux vars and also the model info Base.show includes aux vars
- [ ] recheck function examples and docs (include output description)
- [ ] Docs: document outputs and associated functions to work with function
- [ ] write documentation/docstrings using copilot
- [ ] feedback: sell the sampler better (ESS vs dynare), more details on algorithm (SS solver)
- [ ] NaNMath pow does not work (is not substituted)
- [ ] check whether its possible to run parameters macro/block without rerunning model block
- [ ] eliminate possible log, ^ terms in parameters block equations - because of nonnegativity errors
- [ ] throw error when equations appear more than once
- [ ] plot multiple solutions or models - multioptions in one graph
- [ ] make SS calc faster (func and optim, maybe inplace ops)
- [ ] try preallocation tools for forwarddiff
- [ ] add nonlinear shock decomposition
- [ ] check obc once more
- [ ] rm obc vars from get_SS
- [ ] check why warmup_iterations = 0 makes estimated shocks larger
- [ ] use analytical derivatives also for shocks matching optim (and HMC - implicit diff)
- [ ] info on when what filter is used and chosen options are overridden
- [ ] check warnings, errors throughout. check suppress not interfering with pigeons
- [ ] functions to reverse state_update (input: previous shock and current state, output previous state), find shocks corresponding to bringing one state to the next
- [ ] cover nested case: min(50,a+b+max(c,10))
- [ ] add balanced growth path handling
- [ ] higher order solutions: some kron matrix mults are later compressed. write custom compressed kron mult; check if sometimes dense mult is faster? (e.g. GNSS2010 seems dense at higher order)
- [ ] make inversion filter / higher order sols suitable for HMC (forward and reverse diff!!, currently only analytical pushforward, no implicitdiff) | analytic derivatives
- [ ] speed up sparse matrix calcs in implicit diff of higher order funcs
- [ ] compressed higher order derivatives and sparsity of jacobian
- [ ] add user facing option to choose sylvester solver
- [ ] autocorr and covariance with derivatives. return 3d array
- [ ] use ID for sparse output sylvester solvers (filed issue)
- [ ] add pydsge and econpizza to overview
- [ ] add for loop parser in @parameters
- [ ] implement more multi country models
- [ ] speed benchmarking (focus on ImplicitDiff part)
- [ ] for cond forecasting allow less shocks than conditions with a warning. should be svd then
- [ ] have parser accept rss | (r[ss] - 1) * 400 = rss
- [ ] when doing calibration with optimiser have better return values when he doesnt find a solution (probably NaN)
- [ ] sampler returned negative std. investigate and come up with solution ensuring sampler can continue
- [ ] automatically adjust plots for different legend widths and heights
- [ ] include weakdeps: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Weak-dependencies
- [ ] have get_std take variables as an input
- [ ] more informative errors when something goes wrong when writing a model
- [ ] initial state accept keyed array, SS and SSS as arguments
- [ ] plot_model_estimates with unconditional forecast at the end
- [ ] kick out unused parameters from m.parameters
- [ ] use cache for gradient calc in estimation (see DifferentiableStateSpaceModels)
- [ ] write functions to debug (fix_SS.jl...)
- [ ] model compression (speed up 2nd moment calc (derivatives) for large models; gradient loglikelihood is very slow due to large matmuls) -> model setup as maximisation problem (gEcon) -> HANK models
- [ ] implement global solution methods
- [ ] add more models

- [ ] use @assert for errors and @test_throws
- [ ] print SS dependencies (get parameters (in function of parameters) into the dependencies), show SS solver
- [ ] use strings instead of symbols internally
- [ ] write how-to for calibration equations
- [ ] make the nonnegativity trick optional or use nanmath?
